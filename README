Arduino-based reflow oven shield based on the Rocketscream Reflow Shield- 

http://www.rocketscream.com/shop/reflow-oven-controller-shield-arduino-compatible

This design is based around an etchable shield that takes an Arduino Pro
as the driver board. As opposed to an Uno in order to save cash.

A word of warning that this will utilise 240v power from the relay to drive the oven..

Please see the BOM for details of parts, included in the git are the eagle files to develop the main board and the modified Rocketscream software.
